# sqlite3 CLI is required by the disaster-recovery runbook
# (docs-site/src/content/docs/self-hosting/backups-upgrades.md) for
# PRAGMA integrity_check / .recover — the Python sqlite3 stdlib module
# only exposes the C API, not the CLI's dot-commands.
# Version intentionally unpinned: Debian package versions age out of the
# mirror, and sqlite3 CLI compatibility here is not version-sensitive.
#
# `apt-get upgrade` pulls Debian security updates for packages inherited from
# the base image. Without it the image ships whatever was current when
# python:3.12-slim was last rebuilt upstream, which lags Debian's security
# archive — and the trivy gate in CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml and
# publish.yml) fails the build on any HIGH/CRITICAL that already has a fix.
